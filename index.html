        <p id="intro">Hey! I am currently a freshman at The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I study computer
            science. I have previously interned at <a class="work" href="https://vimeo.com/about">Vimeo</a> as an iOS
            engineering intern. Some of my hobbies include running, reading, <a href="music.html" class="work">listening to music</a>, <a href="food.html" class="work">trying new foods</a>, and
            <a href="portfolio.html" class ="work">taking photos</a>. You can find my resume <a href="resources/nisharesume.pdf" class="work">here</a>. Below are some of the past leadership and technical

            <h1 class="projectTitle"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vimeo/id425194759" class="work">Siri Shortcuts</a></h1>
            <p class="projectDescription">My intern project for my summer at Vimeo was to create a Siri Shortcut 
                for the iOS application using Swift. Vimeo is a completely ad-free video platform and they have multiple subscription tiers
                 for users such as professional videographers to upload and own their content. The Vimeo Siri Shortcut feature that I created
                 learns which privacy setting a user was uploading videos with most frequently in the Vimeo iOS application. Then the user will
                  receive a notification to upload a video with their most used privacy setting. By clicking on this notification, the user is immediately 
                  brought to the Vimeo upload flow with the privacy setting already populated. I was also able to localize this feature by making it available in
                   all the languages that Vimeo supports. This feature is currently in production in the Vimeo iOS application.</p>

            <p class="projectDescription">My junior year of high school, I founded CompSci Kids, a program that promotes the importance of computer science to elementary
                and middle school students. Some of my duties as the founder and co-president of the club included creating curriculum, advertising the club to students, 
                recruiting high school volunteers, and overseeing six classrooms with students ranging from first to eighth grade.
                The curriculum I created utilizes technologies such as Scratch, Code.org, Alice, and Visual Basic and incorporates unplugged activites.</p>

            <p class="projectDescription">This web application is a collection of helpful tools for both math team coaches and students to practice questions 
                and get updates on upcoming activities. To create this application, I utilized user authentication so that students and coaches can log into 
                the website and practice questions. Coaches can then view students' accuracy rates and question attempts from the admin view. This application
                was built using the Python framework, Django, as well as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</p>
